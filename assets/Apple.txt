Apple CEO Tim Cook revealed the Apple Watch last fall as his big bet for the tech giant's next frontier of growth.

Now, with the gadget heading to market in April, it's time for the sales pitch.

Apple will have a chance to do just that at an event Monday morning at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, where the company is expected to devote the bulk of the presentation to the watch. Although Cook has frequently been spotted in public sporting the watch since its unveiling in September, analysts say the company has yet to make a persuasive case for why consumers should pay hundreds of dollars for a tiny computer tailored for the wrist. So far its pitch has alternately touted the gadget's health and fitness tracking, communication tricks and style.
